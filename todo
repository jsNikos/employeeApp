- employee-editor: assign role to employee (from drop-down)
  The backend must populate the 'roles' of the new create doc
- create login-page
- create message page
- create broadcaster service

- create swapper mechanism in schedule-page
  (first allow all shift to be swapped)
* when ask-to-swap send message to others
* use websocket/broadcaster to push
* if one accepts send message back that was accepted
  and change schedule of both; again use broadcaster
  to push the schedule update to clients

- create schedule
* something what works quick in mobile
* schedule by employee/role
* create 2h/4h/8h button -> select role -> show in editor -> ok/cancel
* overlay from last-week
* show problematic shifts and let fix by flowing throw process
